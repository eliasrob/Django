Make sure you are withing the venv by doing the following:
    .\jobapp\jobappenv\Scripts\Activate

then within the venv you check your pip3 list
    if you need pip3 upgrade the previous command will tell you so and provide both 
    path to pip3 and command to upgrade.

then check for python3 using same method - you should have it already.

finally check for django using:
    django-admin --version, if you don't have it installed then use this line:
        pip3 install django

once all packages are installed, use pip3 list to verify the packages installed.

then create a django app:
    django-admin startproject "appname".
    notice the . above which will tell django to create a project but without a new folder
    so the app called "appname" will be created under the the root folder.


and finally to run it:
    python manage.py runserver
